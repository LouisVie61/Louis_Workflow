# Week 1: AI Training - Effective Usage & Critical Thinking

## Objectives

Master AI collaboration workflows to apply effectively in subsequent weeks.

**Focus Areas:**
- Understand core mindset: AI as collaborative tool, you as architect
- Master critical thinking principles and essential questions
- Learn and practice 3 core workflows:
  - Layered Questioning (Research → Brief → Example → Validation)
  - Solution Exploration (Explore options → Compare → Choose with context)
  - Iterative Refinement (Review → Summarize → Refine → Feedback → Validate)
- Recognize and handle AI hallucinations
- Apply workflows through hands-on research practice

## Training Materials

- AI Training Slides: [`slides-ai-training.md`](../../../slides-ai-training.md) - Mindset & Effective Usage

## Week 1 Focus: AI Workflows Mastery

This week focuses on mastering AI collaboration workflows through theory and hands-on research practice. Candidates will learn core mindset, critical thinking principles, and three essential workflows (Layered Questioning, Solution Exploration, Iterative Refinement) before applying them to research Hexagonal Architecture.

## Homework Assignment

**Research Task:** Research Hexagonal Architecture using controlled AI workflows

**Research focus:**
- **Core principles** - What is Hexagonal Architecture? Components and how it works ?
- **Pros & Cons** - Advantages and disadvantages of Hexagonal Architecture
- **When to apply** - Use cases and scenarios where it's suitable
- **Alternatives** - Compare with other architecture patterns

**Apply workflows:**
1. **Layered Questioning** - Research → Brief → Example → Validation
2. **Solution Exploration** - Explore options → Compare pros/cons → Choose with context
3. **Iterative Refinement** - Review AI suggestions → Refine → Feedback → Validate

**Deliverable:** Research documents are saved with:
- Core principles of Hexagonal Architecture
- Pros and cons of Hexagonal Architecture
- When to apply (use cases, scenarios)
- Comparison with alternative architecture patterns
- Evidence of applying all 3 workflows

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Research content is documented: Core principles, Pros & Cons, When to apply, Alternatives
- [ ] Research process with AI is tracked: Workflows applied and iterations documented
- [ ] Research findings can be explained clearly when submitting
- [ ] Questions about Hexagonal Architecture can be answered based on research

## Preparation for Week 2

After Week 1, you should be ready to:
- Use AI effectively when building CLI tool with Hexagonal Architecture
- Apply workflows when making technical decisions
- Review and refine AI suggestions before using them
- Recognize when AI suggestions need correction

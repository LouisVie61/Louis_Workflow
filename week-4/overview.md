# Week 4: Ticket Handling & Professional Communication

## Objectives

- Master ticket handling workflow in Odoo
- Practice professional communication (ticket responses + email drafts)
- Learn MindX's 7-step process and Class of Service framework
- Handle realistic support scenarios
- Build professional communication skills
- Prepare for Week 5 reporting and analysis

## Learning Approach: Practice-Based

Week 4 focuses on **hands-on practice** with real scenarios. Candidates will learn Odoo ticket system workflow, apply MindX 7-step process, classify tickets by Class of Service, and practice with 6 realistic ticket scenarios.

## MindX Framework (Simple)

**7 Steps:** Reception → Response → Diagnosis → Resolution → Updates → Follow-up → Analysis

**Class of Service:**

- Standard (< 5 users)
- Priority (5-25 users)
- Expedite (> 25 users)
- Fixed Deadline (time-driven)

**Tools:** Odoo for tickets, email (draft) for communication practice

## Week 4 Practice Scenarios

Candidates will practice with 6 ticket scenarios:
- Login issue (Standard)
- Performance problem (Priority)
- Critical bug (Expedite)
- Feature request handling
- Multi-user issue
- Deadline-driven request

Each scenario: ~30-45 min, includes template and evaluation checklist.
